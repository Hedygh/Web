						<h1> Four Smoothies for Four Seasons </h1> 

						<p> Since we're giving out recipes, might as well divide them into four seasons. What's
						the point you will ask ? Don't you dress in a different way as the seasons go by ? 
						Well you have it ! 
						<br>
						<strong> Wait a sec ! </strong> Determined in making one of the Smoothies listed below ?
						Make sure you have a Blender, wich is necessary in accomplishing these formulas.
						You might find your happiness by checking this link : 
						<span class="blender"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=blender&ref=nb_sb_noss_2" style="color:black">
								Blenders on Amazon </a> </span>
						(Or at the nearby shop &#128521;). </p> 


						<h2> Greener Winter </h2>
						<p> When the cold has come you could feel your shape decreasing. There's no better to fill up your energy bar 
						than a vitamin drink.</p>
						<p> <span class="smtname">The Dragonfly</span> </p> 
						<div class="fstrec">
							<div>
								What you need :
								<ul> 
									<li> 2 Giants Apples. </li>
									<li> Lemon juice. </li> 
									<li> A handfull of Mache. </li>
									<li> Water as disered constitancy. </li>
									<li> (optionnal) 2 Kiwi.
								</ul> 
							</div> 
							<div>
								<img src="img/smoot1.jpg" class="imgrec1" alt="failed to load">
							</div> 
						</div>
						<p> This will be interesting. The apples never stops expanding it's benefits list.
						The one benefit we're looking for  here is that it gives energy (full vitamin gain).
						The mache on the  is well known as an anti-stress.
						Finally the Lemon juice, among all its qualities, can avoid cramps and fatigue.
						</p>

						<h2> Hello Spring </h2>
						<div>
						<p>Spring : Chanting birds, sunlight, flowers, love, and ... Smoothies ! 
						As nature awaken from her long sleep
						it should only be fair to enjoy the seasonnal fruits. </p>
						<p> <span class="smtname"> The Luminous </span> </p>
						<div class="fstrec"> 
							<div>
								What you need :
								<ul>
									<li> 1 Pear. </li>
									<li> 1 Ripe banana. </li>
									<li> 1 tbs of Lemon juice. </li>
									<li> Half a mango (or mango juice).</li>
									<li> A few drop of Vanilla extract.</li>
									<li> extra icecube for freshness. </li>
									<li> Water for wished texture. </li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div> 
								<img src="img/smoot2.jpg" class="imgrec2" alt="couldn't load">
							</div> 
						</div> 
						</div>
						<p> This one mostly was about delish. Still, this won't stop the pear from reducing
						risks of heart problems, the mango for applying its anti-cancer propertys nor the
						vanilla for its antidepressant effects. </p>

						<h2> Fall of Autumn </h2>

						<p> I have to admit saying Fall instead of Autumn sounds like music to my ears. 
						Fall is the season of warm colors, candles, Halloween and more importantly
						grappes return.</p>
						<p> <span class="smtname"> The My-Precious </span> </p> 
						<div class="fstrec">
							<div>
								What you need : 
								<ul>
									<li> A handfull of Raspberrys.</li> 
									<li> A handfull of Blackberrys.</li>
									<li> Half a lemon. </li>
									<li> A bunch of Grapes (red or white).</li>
									<li> Water to make it smoother.</li>
									<li> Half a cap of rum and brown sugar.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<img src="img/smoot3.jpg" class="imgrec3" alt="couldn't load">
							</div>
						</div>
						<p> More and more studys are coming out about welfare of grappes. Aside from
						all its health benefits it can increase focusness and fortify your mood. Blackberrys
						can be very usefull in case of sore throat. As for the rum it can soothe (not smoothe)
						the cough (a moderate dose).</p>


						<h2> Simple Summer</h2>

						<p> For most of us, Summer is a time for the beach, the sun, the good times, the holidays, the 
						weight gain, the ... wait a sec ! It's also time watch your weight, and staying hydrated. 
						</p>
						<p> <span class="smtname"> The Water stream </span> </p>
						<div class="fstrec">
							<div>
								What you need :
								<ul>
									<li> Half a Melon </li>
									<li> Half a Watermelon</li>
									<li> 1 Cucumber </li>
									<li> 2 Pressed green lemon </li>
									<li> Ice cubes and water </li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<img src="img/smoot4.jpg" class="imgrec4" alt="couldn't load">
							</div>
						</div>
						<p> This Smoothie bets on water based ingrediants. Melon is fighting water retention
						and help protecting from high blood pressure. Composed of 95% water the Cucumber
						is a natural antioxidants and also can aid weight loss (bonus : fresh breath).
						The watermelon lies almost in the same bed as the Melon. Experts also found out that it can
						prevent the development of asthma.</p>
