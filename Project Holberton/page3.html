						<h1> My Smooth Morning </h1>
						<p> We all have our own morning routine. Waking up earlier
						than usual to provide a special time for ourself. A time for
						intellectual, physical and spiritual self-development. Depending on
						the individual many activities can provide to our morning rituals. 
						Can it be workout, yoga, writing, stretching, making a smoothie ?
						<br>
						The morning routine is a recent concept that was unconsciously 
						present in close to all of our lives. As for mine, the Smoothie
						making is part of it and will be our main topic here.
						</p>

						<h2> Breakfast or Smoothie </h2>

						<p> What if we combine the two to make the Smoothie our Breakfast. Would
						it be enough ?
						<br>
						 Many researchs argue that breakfast is an important meal of the day
						and others that it may be better to skip it. My tought on the subject is
						simple : eat breakfast as you feel hungry.
						<br>
						Let's suppose we are hungry in the morning. Why would we succomb to
						the ease of drinking juice with too much added sugar ? Making a Smoothie instead
						is quick, easy and healthy. </p> 

						<h3> My Smooth-Making </h3> 

						<p> You guessed it, I am making a Smoothie every morning. The recipe is
						simple and definitely worth trying. In this  usual order
						to make the mixing go smoother let's find out what I'm using.</p>


						<div class="c1item3"> <h4> The Base fruit : Banana </h4></div>

						<div class="sndrec">
							<div><img src="img/bananas.png" class="bana" alt="banana image"></div>
							<div> <p><strong> Making : </strong> Usually 2 bananas, depending on the size. 
							It must be pretty ripe to have the expected taste (peal with leopard like dots is 
							the one). It should mix pretty easily but it's
							always better to break them in half before mixing. </p> </div>
						</div>
						<p><strong> Note : </strong> We all know how popular the Bananas are and
						it's not without evidences. The main reason I'm using it is because 
						of the belly filling and of course I enjoy the taste. You will also be thankfull
						 for the milky texture of the drink. This fruit
						is the base of my morning drink. Without it, I'll just make cofee. 
						</p>

						<div class="c1item3"><h4> The Icy Strawberries </h4> </div>  
						<div class="sndrec"> 
							<div> <img src="img/strawb.png" class="strawb" alt="strawberries image"> </div>
							<div><p><strong> Making : </strong> The correct dosage is also
								depending on the size of each. Usually I'm using frozen
								strawberries. The conservation of fresh ones is pretty tough
								as you only get 5 to 6 days to eat them. However it is
								always best to use fresh ones if you have some. </p></div>
						</div>
						<p><strong> Note : </strong> Aside from the fact that Strawberries is in my
						top 10 favorites fruits, the benefits you can get from it are countless. It produce
						vitamin C naturally wich help you to get your daily dose of it. Strawberries became
						a crucial part of my morning drink. Frozen most of the time the good thing is your
						Smoothie will already be cold.</p>


						<div class="c1item3"><h4> The Red bonus Mix</h4> </div>
						<div class="sndrec"> 
							<div> <img src="img/bemix.png" class="mixbrs" alt="red fruits mix image"> </div>
							<div> <p><strong> Making :</strong> Adding it as a bonus to make it a bit 
								more acid and red. As i do for strawberries, I'm usually using frozen red
								mix. If you have any of the red fruits mix as individual it won't
								hurt to use it.</p></div> 
						</div>
						<p><strong> Note : </strong> Bonus imply that you can make the Smoothie
						without. Still using the red fruits mix can be the cherry on top to your drink. Gooseberrys,
						raspberrys, blueberries, blackberries or cassis. Each of it will have its own effect on your 
						well being.
						</p>

						<div class="c1item3"><h4> Almond Flour </h4> </div>
						<div class="sndrec">
							<div> <img src="img/almond.png" class="almond" alt="almond image"> </div>
							<div> <p><strong> Making :</strong> Not only powder but also straight up smashed almonds 
								can also be used, it's
								always better to have almond flour instead for easier mixing. About 3 to 4 tbs is enough
								but you can add as much as you can wistand. </p> </div>
						</div>
						<p><strong> Note :</strong> This is where the difference between a fruits based juice and 
						a breakfast meal is made. As you may know the Almond deliver a massive amount of nutrients as
						proteins, fibers, and others various vitamins. This may not be a necessary ingredient to my Smoothie,
						given that when I'm out of it I'm still making the mix, but I'm still missing it.
						</p> 

						<div class="c1item3"> <h4> Lemon Always</h4> </div> 
						<div class="sndrec"> 
							<div> <img src="img/lemon.png" class="lemon" alt="lemon image"> </div>
							<div><p><strong> Making :</strong> Simply cut a lemon in half for juice extraction. You can also grate
							the lemon fibers for stronger taste. Also remember you can always use the remaining zest for various
							cooking recipes.</div>
						</div>

						<p><strong> Note :</strong> The Lemon juice is not a crucial element of this recipe but it will  add
						obvious benefits to the mix. I personnaly enjoy the extra spice it brings. Know that
						it always help throughout weight loss diet, improves your skin quality and many others positives
						effects to it. However use it moderately. </p>
						
						<p><strong> Remember </strong> that <strong>water</strong> is necessary to make the recipe works as in 
						almost any other Smoothie making. The more water, thiner the texture. </p>
